# Brainstorming Ideas:

## General:

## Ideation:

### Parflow Workflow
1. Interpolating data-sparce hydrogeology (K) Domains
2. Interpolating data-sparse surface vegetation
3. Streamburning processing
4. Parameterization
5. Regionalization of big US-wide Models
6.

### Convergence Accelerator:
* Tasks:
  * What if we think bigger, and use ML to fill data-sparse domains?
  * Change the data for implementation in ML data training
  * I'm not sure I get the streamflow v spatially distributed dichotomy. ML can definitely handle multi-dimensional learning, and in fact is great at doing things with photos and with videos, for e.g.
  * Could be a part of STEM outreach!
    * I feel like finding new collaborators should be a part of your outreach objective. Build a field, will they come?
  * From Table (1):
    * review datasets and developing FAIR metadata standards
    * Developing flexible, interoperable, itelligent APIs, linking data to existing ML frameworks
    * Building and testing infrastructure for efficient access to large datasets
    * tiered staged data access and archiving

### Misc:
1. Using LSTM as a 'forward' extrapolator (i.e. to predict the changes / trends in physical parameters through time into a climate-uncertain future)
2. Streamflow?
