## Lecture Deep Learning in Hydrology: From a Niche to Solving Core Challenge Prof. Chaopeng Shen
### Overview:
  There remain lots of opportunities for learning with DL in hydrology. Some things that are worth further investigation area.
    - Use of PINN (Physically Informed Neural Networks)
    - DI v LSTM (DI = Data Integration, new technique)
    - How to use LSTM as a forward extrapolator
### Notes
    1. LSTM still Good
    2. Forecasting:
      * Better for streamflow, DI
      * DI in stream prediction
        * Look this article up
      * Use DL to do uncertainty estimation
        * Monte Carlo Drop Out
      * Use DL as a Gaussian Process
    3. Big Opportunities:
      * Predictions in Ungauged Basins
        * Sparse Data region
          * 'Transfer Learning'
            * Train data in one region with big Data
            * Then move it over to a basin with very little Data
      * Parameter Calibration:
        * From Parameter Estimation to Parameter Learning in Physics-based Models
      * Can fix problems with Equifinality
        * Expert-driven solutions to equifinality are biased
      * Multiscale modeling:
        * Connect finescale to coarse-scale model
      * Human Influences Reservoirs:
    4. Q/A
      * Process Based Models
        * 'bottom up'
      * Big Data Machine learning
        * 'top down'

      * Learning from Machine LEARNING
        * In order for us to learn the fundamentals, we need a supervised carefully constructed network...

      * Precipitation:
        * UC-Irvine

      * Big noisy data is better than small clean data for DL

      * Use models to estimate error:

      * Heterogeneity biological factors limits ability to process-based Models
