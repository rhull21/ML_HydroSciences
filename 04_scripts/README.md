# scripts
## A sub repo containing python scripts and related data from python + DL experimentation

1. LSTM_Verde
  * LSTM_Verde(1,2,3...).py - Different versions of my experiments with LSTM and the data at Verde River (autoregression). The most recent is probably the most useful. Using the Keras module.
    * Related: Streamflow.txt - Data related to the above
2. generalML
  * timeseries.py - From a basic tutorial using LSTM in autoregression using the Keras module.
    * Related: airline-passengers.csv
  * ML.py - Intro experimentation re: ML and DL in python. (Including)
    * (_1_) A generic tutorial for python and ML @ https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-in-python-step-by-step/
    * (_2_) A tutorial on k-fold-cross-validation
    * (_3_) From 2020. Youchan Hu, Stream-Flow Forecasting of Small Rivers Based on LSTM

3. data
  * contains related data
4. pytorch
  * pytorch_blitz.py - The first pytorch tutorial (60 minute blitz) (took me longer than 60 minutes)
    * Related: data - folder of fotos from the 60 minutes blitz
  * pytorch_examples.py - based on some pytorch tutorials availble here: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/pytorch_with_examples.html
5. numba - tutorial for numba (for using GPU with Python) from repo gtc2017-numba
  * 1 - Numba Basics.ipynb - an intro into Numba with modifications
