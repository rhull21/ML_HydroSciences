# scripts
## A sub repo containing python scripts and related data from python + DL experimentation

1. LSTM_Verde.py (1,2,3...) - Different versions of my experiments with LSTM and the data at Verde River (autoregression). The most recent is probably the most useful. Using the Keras module.
  * Related: Streamflow.txt - Data related to the above
  * Related: Verde_Outputs (a file of figures / tables outputted from this work)
2. timeseries.py - From a basic tutorial using LSTM in autoregression using the Keras module.
  * Related: airline-passengers.csv
3. ML.py - Intro experimentation re: ML and DL in python. (Including)
  * (_1_) A generic tutorial for python and ML @ https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-in-python-step-by-step/
  * (_2_) A tutorial on k-fold-cross-validation
  * (_3_) From 2020. Youchan Hu, Stream-Flow Forecasting of Small Rivers Based on LSTM
4. pytorch_tutorials.py - The first pytorch tutorial (60 minute blitz) (took me longer than 60 minutes)
  * Related: data - folder of fotos from the 60 minutes blitz
