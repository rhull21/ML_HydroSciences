# %% 
# Goal: 
# # Use fully-connected ReLU network
# # single hidden layer
# # train with gradient descent to fit random data
# # minimizing Euclidean distance between
# # network output and true output

# Outline:
# # (1) implement network using numpy 
# # # a kind of hack approach, but will work for 
# # # very simple ML questions
# # (2) Introduce the Tensor
# # # PyTorch is necessary to utilize GPUs for complex DL
# # # Tensor is fundamental to PyTorch
# # # Similar to Numpy Arrays, with added bells and whistles
# # # # including 1) track graph and gradients
# # # # 2) additional scientific computing tools
# # # # 3) GPUs can be used to accelerate numeric computations
# # (3) Autograd
# # # autograd allows for automatic computation of gradients
# # # 'backward passes' in neural networks
# # # utilizes automatic differentiation (because gradients)
# # # are partial derivatives, after all
# # (4) Defining new autograd functions
# # # the autograd operator is actually two functions
# # # a) Forward function computes outputs from inputs
# # # b) backward function receives the gradient of the
# # # output tensors and computes the gradeint of the
# # # input tensors, counting backwards through all layers
# # (5) nn module
# # # computational graphs and autograd are powerful 
# # # but too low level for large neural networks
# # # in this case, we arrange computation into layers
# # # which have learnable parameters that can be 
# # # optimized during learning
# # (6) optim
# # # the optim package in PyTorch abstracts the idea of an 
# # # an optimization algorithm and provides implementaions
# # # of commonly used optimization algorithms
# # (7) Custom nn modules
# # (8) Control Flow and Weight Sharing
# # # a fully-connected ReLU network that on each forward
# # # pass chooses a random number between 1 and 4 and uses 
# # # that many hidden layers, reusing the same weights 
# # # multiple times to compute the innermost hidden layers.
